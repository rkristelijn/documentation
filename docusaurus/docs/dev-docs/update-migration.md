# Updates and Migrations

Strapi periodically releases code improvements through new versions. New Strapi versions are announced in both the terminal and in the administration panel, and [GitHub release notes](https://github.com/strapi/strapi/releases) list what is new with each new version.

Whenever a new Strapi version is available, there are 2 possible cases:

| Does the new Strapi version include breaking changes? | The upgrade process is a/an… | Can you use the `upgrade` tool? | Additional information         |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| No                                                    | Update                       | Yes                             | See generic [update guide](/dev-docs/update-version) |
| Yes                                                   | Migration                    | Yes                             | See specific migration guides (see below)            |

There are 2 types of migrations:
- migrating from a minor version to another minor version (e.g., from v5.x to v5.y)
- migrating from a major version to another major version (e.g., from v4.x to v5.0)

Depending on your use case, click on any of the following cards to read detailed instructions to upgrade to the desired version:
